gamen (画面 / *screen* from japanese) is an open source developer portal framework enabling day 2 actions for developer.

The motivation for this project is:
- most notable open source alternative, backstage, is built on full stack javascript, which is not very favoured by cloud native communities
- port is paid
- creating an opiniated developer portal where infrastructure team can focus only to designing the logic
- portfolio for a platform engineer wannabe :3

This project is in very early stage. Therefore, any criticism or recommendation about the project is very welcomed. Or even better, a pull request :D
